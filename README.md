## Guidance on requester personal information

Following the advice of expert Turkers, we discourage workers from posting personal requester information in reviews, flags, comments, or posts to turkopticon-discuss, even if the information can be found through Google or is otherwise publicly available. This includes a requester's personal email address (e.g., an address other than that associated with a requester's place of employment), home or cell phone number, or home address, unless it is included in the HIT (e.g., in a consent form workers are expected to read before completing a HIT associated with an academic study). If such information is posted, we reserve the right to censor this information at a requester's request, or at our discretion. However, we do not **guarantee** that such information will be censored, even at a requester's request.
